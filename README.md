## Hi there, i'm Herivelto! ðŸ‘‹

**HeriSwoS/HeriSwoS** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own game of TCG Fantasy at Legacy Fate
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Game Desenvolviment
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate only on my project
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recruitment
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about fame development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: calaboucosdosdragoes@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy running RPG sessions and playing TCGs, so I decided to create a game that combines both.
